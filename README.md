# Hi, Welcome to Redd's Art!

As a fan of Animal Crossing, I'm Addicted to the game for 2 months.

<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch/" target="_blank">**Animal Crossing™: New Horizons**</a>

Jolly Redd actually came to my island only 4 times, my museum is still poor of artworks.

**So I make this website for AC fans to view all Jolly Redd's Arts and learn more about those famous artworks in the word.**
